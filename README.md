# iRoom 3.0
My goal is to create a fully voice controlled house. Nowaday that kind of systems are really expensive and you have to change multiple devices. I don't want to replace anything just modify what's existing and create a complete new world.

## How ?
I have to create a voice to text (and text to voice) system. Since I'm not a 500 engineers team I had to lookup to the market something that do this for me. After something like 10 minutes, I found the Google Home Mini which is perfect for I have to do. It's compatible with IFTT, some Homebridge package exist to control any Google Home object from Siri (Yes I have an iPhone ...).
Now the next step was the music. I love music. I just can't work without any music ! That's why I started my project from this point. Create a voice controlled HiFi systems.
